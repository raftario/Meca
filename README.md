# Meca

Native Android development made easy

![Build](https://github.com/raftario/Meca/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

Meca is a **WIP** tool targeted at developers working on standalone C/C++ Android projects outside of Android Studio.
It can manage concurrent NDK installations, download new ones, properly set environment variables for builds and generate Makefiles.
The end goal is to create a fully featured package manager for NDK based projects, including Git-backed dependencies support.

## Progression

- [ ] Download new NDKs
- [ ] Set active NDK
- [ ] Manage existing NDKs
- [ ] Generate Makefiles

## Supported platforms

Meca only supports 64 bit Windows, macOS and Linux, just like newer versions of the Android NDK.

## License

Meca is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
